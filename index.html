                        As I said, puppies (and kittens) are cute. Interestingly, people's responses were independent of pet
                        ownership. Despite our preference for dogs and cats, our response is remarkably robust. Several

                        Adult chickens are described in
                        many ways, but "cute" is rarely among them.

                    <h1>Puppies are SOFT !</h1>
                    <p>
                        When puppies are little, their undercoat is what is most pronounced. Their outer coat is still
                        growing and has yet to grow past their fluffy undercoat. That’s why puppies are so soft as babies;
                        because they haven’t grown out their outer coats yet.

                        Puppies are born after an average of 63 days of gestation, puppies emerge in an amnion that is
                        bitten off and eaten by the mother dog.
